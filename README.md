(In this project i have taken a slight idea from chatgpt.)
Pokémon Card Viewer
Pokémon Card Viewer is a Flutter application that retrieves and displays Pokémon cards using the Pokémon Trading Card Game API. Users can browse through a collection of cards and tap on them to view a larger version.

Features
Fetches Pokémon card data from the Pokémon TCG API.
Displays a list of cards, showing their images and names.
Utilizes CachedNetworkImage for efficient image loading and caching.
Provides a pop-up dialog for viewing enlarged card images.


Installation & Running the App
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokemon-card-viewer.git  
cd pokemon-card-viewer  
Install dependencies:

flutter pub get  
Run the app on an emulator or physical device:

flutter run  
Projec
pokemon_card_viewer/  
                  
The project relies on the following Flutter packages:

flutter: The core framework for UI development.
http: For fetching Pokémon card data from the API.
cached_network_image: To optimize image loading and caching.
API Integration
The app retrieves Pokémon card data from:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET https://api.pokemontcg.io/v2/cards  
The response is in JSON format and is parsed into PokemonCard objects.

How It Works
The app starts with PokemonCardViewer, which initializes PokemonCardList.
PokemonCardList fetches card data asynchronously.
The data is displayed using ListView.builder.
Tapping on a card opens a dialog with a larger image.           in this project i have taken a slight idea from chatgpt.
